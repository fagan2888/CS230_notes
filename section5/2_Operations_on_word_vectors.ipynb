    "### Equalization algorithm for gender-specific words\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets see how debiasing can also be applied to word pairs such as `actress` and `actor`. Equalization is applied to pairs of words that you might want to have differ only through the gender property. As a concrete example, suppose that `actress` is closer to `babysit` than `actor`. By applying neutralizing to `babysit` we can reduce the gender-stereotype associated with babysitting. But this still does not guarantee that `actor` and `actress` are equidistant from `babysit`. The equalization algorithm takes care of this. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind equalization is to make sure that a particular pair of words are equi-distant from the 49-dimensional $g_\\perp$. The equalization step also ensures that the two equalized steps are now the same distance from $e_{receptionist}^{debiased}$, or from any other work that has been neutralized. \n",
